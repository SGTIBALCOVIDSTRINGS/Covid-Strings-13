covid strings phrase list13=[no accounting of the covid pandemic would be complete without books critiquing what happened
some books include nightmare scenario and uncontrolled spread
another book that goes into detail is lessons from the covid war
crisis and chaos is an example that can go more broadly into healthcare as a whole
even if you didnt have a nonfiction book or report you might have had something
fiction though is a little harder right now
a more serious subject involves what happens if trump wants to be like woodrow wilson during the spanish flu
it is clear that the25th amendment would have to be invoked if necessary
